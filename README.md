## Revolution Mod watchface

Modified by [Paul Fung](http://www.kpfung.com).

The aim of this modification is to extend the watch battery life by removing its per-second update from the watchface.

Changelog:
* Removed SECONDS from the watchface
* Changed the per-second callback function to a per-minute replacement
* Aligned DATE to the right side of the screen
* Shortened animation time to 100ms

Thanks to Douwe for his source code to this beautiful watchface.

Implemented by Douwe Maan.

Envisioned as a watchface by Jean-NoÃ«l Mattern (Jnm), who posted it in the ["Watch-face ideas" thread](http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/comment/3538/#Comment_3538) on the Pebble forums.

Based on the display of the [Freebox Revolution](http://www.free.fr/adsl/freebox-revolution.html), which was designed by Philippe Starck.
